        "responses": ["Well…it depends on whether you want to go for higher studies (Doctorate degree in Science) or you want to get a job and settle early in your career. Depending on your interest, you can apply and prepare for the competitive exams like CSIR-UGC NET, GATE, BARC etc. After qualifying MSc + NET, you are eligible for lectureship as well as Assistant professor jobs. Once you qualfy NET JRF exam or GATE, you can apply for PhD in any of the premium institutes like IISc, IISER or IITs. And if you are not keen to join academics and research, then prepare well for Gate exam. Through Gate result you can apply for job at ONGC as well as BARC. BARC also conducts its own exam for Scientific officer posts after MSc Chemistry. Apart from all this, UPSC also conducts exam for geoscientist almost every year, you can make up your mind for that too.My personal advice would be to join PhD only if you are really interested in doing Research and join only under a good Professor, otherwise go for jobs like BARC or ONGC. Last but not the least, you can also try for faculty positions at coaching institutes like Fiitjee, Akash etc.",
        "All IISERs (except IISER Berhampur presently) offer an integrated Ph.D. programme, i.e. integrated MS and Ph.D., after completion of a B. Sc. degree. Each IISER conducts its own selection process separately for this programme.For admission to an int-Ph.D programme in Chemistry, you are required to appear for and clear the Joint Admission Test for M. Sc. (JAM) examination in Chemistry (JAM-CY). This needs to be the JAM conducted in the same year as when you are applying for admission.While all other IISERs require JAM-CY compulsorily for admission to int-Ph.D. in Chemistry, IISER Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-TVM) has an alternative channel of admission through a separate entrance test conducted by IISER-TVM itself. For details and syllabus of this entrance test, you should refer to their website on this link.You are also required to meet eligibility criteria relating to your performance in the B. Sc. degree. After this, shortlisting is typically done using the score of the entrance tests, which is followed by one or more rounds of interviews/screening tests (conducted by individual IISERs) for final selection.For more details regarding eligibility, shortlisting and final selection, you should refer to int-Ph.D. admissions pages on the websites of the individual IISERs.All the best!",

        "I recently answered a similar question. Please go through that.Manish Gupta's answer to Should I go for masters in my honors or spend 1-2 years preparing for SSC CGL?However, I would like to add something.Msc. in chemistry is a very bright career option. More so, if you are interested in research.Even if you do not want to pursue a Phd program, you can go into teaching profile. Believe me when I tell you, there is a real dearth of good Chemistry teachers in market and I am talking about a metropolitan city like Delhi. (The area I live in is called the coaching hub of Delhi, where you can find 10 coaching institutes within a stretch of 500m and I am not exaggerating.)Even I taught Chemistry to senior students for a few months and am still interested in it.So, if you are really interested in Chemistry then you might regret choosing SSC CGL later in your life.",

        "Depends on what YOU want. Are you interested in any particular field of chemistry, which you want to study/research further? You can give NET and apply for Ph.D. Or do you want a job related to the chemistry? You can give GATE and apply at ONGC, DRDO, etc or other such PSUs/Govt organisations. Also without giving GATE, you can study and give the GSI exam for Scientific assistants.If you want to do something unrelated to chemistry, you can appear for bank/insurance/CGL exams like I did! Also there is UPSC.Another option is completing your B.Ed. and teach in a government aided school.It depends on you what you want to do. I listed a few options, there are many more!Hope it helps.
